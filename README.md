Cardiovascular Disease Detection Using CNN


This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify ECG images into four categories related to cardiovascular health:
Heart Attack, History of Heart Attack, Normal Healthy, and Abnormal Heartbeat. The model is trained using a dataset of ECG images sourced from [Mendeley.com.](https://data.mendeley.com/)
